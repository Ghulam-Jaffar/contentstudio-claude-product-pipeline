## Part A: Competitor & Industry Research

### What is Social Listening?

Social listening is the practice of monitoring digital channels — social media, news, blogs, forums, review sites — for mentions of a brand, competitors, products, or industry keywords, and then **analyzing** that data to draw strategic conclusions and take action.

The key distinction from basic social monitoring:

| Dimension | Social Monitoring | Social Listening |
|---|---|---|
| **Scale** | Micro — individual mentions on owned channels | Macro — broad conversations across the entire web |
| **Orientation** | Reactive — respond to what just happened | Proactive — shape strategy for what's coming |
| **Question answered** | "What are people saying?" | "Why are they saying it, and what does it mean?" |
| **Output** | Alerts and response queues | Insights, trends, sentiment reports, competitive intelligence |
| **Data sources** | Owned channels (your pages, your inbox) | Entire web: social, blogs, forums, news, review sites, podcasts |
| **User role** | Community manager / support agent | Strategist / CMO / product manager |

**Why users want it — five core jobs:**
1. **Brand reputation management** — know when sentiment is shifting before it becomes a crisis
2. **Competitor intelligence** — understand what audiences love or hate about rival products
3. **Content strategy** — discover trending topics and gaps before publishing
4. **Product feedback** — surface unfiltered customer pain points at scale
5. **Campaign measurement** — track share of voice, sentiment, and earned conversation after a launch

**2026 State of the Market:**
- AI sentiment analysis now handles sarcasm, emojis, cultural nuance, and slang with high accuracy
- Predictive analytics modules can forecast topic volume trends before they peak
- Source coverage has expanded to Reddit, TikTok video captions, podcast transcripts, Discord, Twitch, and Bluesky
- Natural language query builders are replacing traditional Boolean syntax for non-technical users
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) have tightened data collection and retention policies

### Common Patterns (Table-Stakes)

Every credible listening tool offers these — users expect them by default:

1. **Keyword and Hashtag Monitoring** — define keywords, phrases, brand names, hashtags; get alerts when new mentions appear
2. **Sentiment Classification** — Positive / Neutral / Negative labels on every mention (minimum); advanced tools use Deep Neural Networks for sarcasm/emoji detection
3. **Multi-Platform Coverage** — X/Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok baseline; Reddit has become mandatory in 2026
4. **Real-Time Alerts** — email or in-app notifications for mentions, especially volume spike detection
5. **Mention Volume Trends** — charts showing mention count over time (daily/weekly/monthly)
6. **Competitor Keyword Tracking** — monitor competitor brand names for basic competitive intelligence
7. **Engage from Listening** — reply to or flag a mention directly from the listening feed without leaving the tool
8. **Exportable Reports** — PDF or CSV exports of mention logs and sentiment summaries

---

### Differentiators (Worth Studying)

1. **AI-Powered Natural Language Query Building** (Talkwalker, Sprout) — translate plain-English descriptions ("negative mentions about my customer support") into structured Boolean queries automatically; dramatically lowers barrier for non-technical marketers

2. **Predictive Trend Forecasting** (Hootsuite/Talkwalker, Brand24) — not just what people say now but what they will say next week; even a "rising vs. falling topics" surface in the last 7 days differentiates vs. tools in the $29–$200/mo range

3. **Share of Voice (SOV)** (Sprout, Brandwatch) — brand's % of total industry conversation vs. competitors; elevates listening from reactive awareness to strategic intelligence

4. **Spike/Crisis Alerts with Context** (Brand24, Determ) — detect abnormal mention volume spikes and alert with sample content ("150% more mentions than 30-day average — here's a sample"); named "Storm Alerts" by Brand24

5. **Emotion Clustering** (Brandwatch) — frustrated vs. excited vs. disappointed vs. hopeful, beyond basic pos/neg/neutral; significantly more actionable for product and CX teams

6. **Influencer Discovery from Listening** (Sprout, Later) — identify most influential accounts talking about a topic/brand, ranked by reach; converts monitoring into growth opportunity

7. **Reddit as First-Class Source** (Agorapulse, Sprout, Brand24) — Reddit is where authentic, unfiltered product feedback lives and where consumer trends originate; Agorapulse launched this explicitly as a new feature in 2025

8. **Respond-from-Listening Workflow** (Hootsuite, Agorapulse, Sprout) — close the loop between discovering a mention and engaging with it without switching tools

### User Expectations

**Table-Stakes (Users Assume These Exist)**

| Feature | Why It's Table-Stakes |
|---|---|
| Brand name / keyword monitoring | Core reason users buy listening at all |
| Sentiment labels (pos/neg/neutral) | Expected since 2018; absence feels outdated |
| Multi-platform coverage (X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) | Bare minimum social footprint |
| Mention volume over time chart | Fundamental analytics view |
| Email alerts for new mentions | Reputation management requires push notification |
| Competitor keyword tracking | Second-most cited use case after brand monitoring |
| Keyword/topic setup wizard | Users should not need documentation to create first topic |
| Export to CSV or PDF | Non-negotiable for agency reporting |

**Delighters (Nice Surprises That Drive Word-of-Mouth)**

| Feature | Why It Delights |
|---|---|
| AI-generated trend summary ("Here's what people said about your brand this week") | Saves hours of manual data interpretation |
| Spike/crisis alerts with context samples | Proactive vs. reactive; feels like a dedicated monitor |
| Predictive trending topics | Makes the user look smart to their boss/client |
| Share of Voice vs. specific competitors | Immediately presentable competitive intelligence |
| Influencer/advocate discovery from listening feed | Converts a monitoring task into a growth opportunity |
| Natural language query builder | Non-technical marketers configure complex queries in 60 seconds |
| Reddit + YouTube + TikTok coverage out-of-the-box | Platforms where authentic sentiment lives |
| One-click respond from listening to Inbox | Closes the loop without context switching |
| Saved listening dashboards per brand/client | Agency users love per-client workspaces |

### Pricing & Packaging Insights

**How the Market Packages Listening:**

1. **Plan-Gated** (Hootsuite) — basic listening on all plans; advanced listening Enterprise-only. Clear upsell path.
2. **Paid Add-On** (Agorapulse $40/search/mo; Sprout ~$999/mo) — optional module on top of any plan. Agorapulse's transparent per-topic pricing is praised; Sprout's opaque pricing generates frustration.
3. **Usage-Based Per-Day** (Metricool $25/day/hashtag) — unpredictable costs; widely noted as a frustration; avoid this model.
4. **Dedicated Tool Subscriptions** (Brand24 $149–$999/mo; Brandwatch $800–$5,000+/mo) — siloed from publishing workflow.

**Key Observations:**
- **The SMB gap is real.** Between Metricool's broken per-day pricing and Sprout's $999/mo add-on, there's almost nothing in the $29–$149/mo range with real listening. ContentStudio can own this tier.
- **Feature floors are rising.** Sentiment analysis is now expected even at $50–$80/mo plans. It must be baseline, not premium.
- **Historical data depth is a proven upsell lever.** 30 days (basic) vs. 90 days (mid) vs. 1 year (premium) is the standard tiering pattern.
- **Topics/queries per plan is the cleanest usage limit.** Cap simultaneous topics (3 basic, 10 mid, unlimited premium) — much better UX than per-mention or per-day pricing.

### Recommended Approach for ContentStudio

**Strategic Framing:**
ContentStudio's ICP is social media managers at agencies and mid-market brands. They want listening **integrated into their existing publishing workflow**, not a separate tool requiring a separate login.

The competitive white space: **accessible, integrated listening for the $29–$149/mo market**, where the SMB options are either broken (Metricool), minimal (Buffer, Sendible), or non-existent (Loomly, SocialBee, Publer). Dedicated tools like Brand24 ($149/mo) are good but siloed.

**ContentStudio's Genuine Differentiator:**
The **closed loop between listening and action** — Discover a mention → Respond via Inbox → Create content from the trend via Composer → Schedule via Planner → Measure via Analytics — all in one platform. No dedicated listening tool offers this. Hootsuite and Sprout come closest but at 3–10x the price.

**Product narrative:** *"Discover → Respond → Create → Publish → Measure"*

**V1 Must-Haves:**
1. Topic/Query Builder with guided wizard + AI-assist for plain-English → structured queries
2. Sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative) powered by NLP
3. Mention feed with filters (platform, sentiment, language, date range, source type)
4. Mention volume chart with date range selection (7/30/90 days)
5. Spike/alert notifications (email + in-app, configurable threshold, context samples)
6. Basic competitor comparison (track competitor brand names; side-by-side mention + sentiment)
7. CSV / PDF export for agency reporting

**V1.5 / V2 High-Value Additions:**
8. Share of Voice widget (brand's % of total conversation vs. tracked competitors)
9. AI Trend Summary (weekly narrative digest: "340 mentions this week, 72% positive, up from 58%...")
10. Top Voices / Influencer Panel (top 5 accounts by reach driving the conversation)
11. Saved dashboards per brand/client for agency workspaces

**Packaging Recommendation:**
- Include basic listening in Starter/Growth plans (not enterprise-only) for platform stickiness
- Gate depth by plan: Starter (3 topics, 30-day history, core social platforms) → Growth/Pro (10 topics, 90-day history, + Reddit/YouTube/TikTok/web) → Agency/Scale (unlimited topics, 1-year history, SOV, AI digest, competitor benchmarking)
- Never use per-day or per-mention pricing — use topics/queries as the usage dimension

- `contentstudio-backend/app/Models/Inbox/InboxCronMaster.php` — cron job tracking
- `contentstudio-backend/app/Models/Inbox/InboxSavedReply.php` — templated responses
- Pusher-based real-time broadcast via `InboxPusherBroadcast`
- Master cron + queue jobs for inbox polling; email notification pipeline; repository-based data access

**Backend — Platform Integrations**
- `contentstudio-backend/app/Libraries/Integrations/Platforms/Social/FacebookPlatform.php` — webhook subscribed fields include **`comments, messages, mentions`**
- `contentstudio-backend/app/Libraries/Integrations/Platforms/Social/InstagramPlatform.php` — webhook subscribed fields include **`comments, messages, mentions`**
- `contentstudio-backend/app/Libraries/Integrations/Platforms/Social/TwitterPlatform.php` — publishing only; no streaming API integration
- All major platforms present: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Tumblr

- `contentstudio-frontend/src/modules/discovery/components/feeder/components/content-view/feed-item/FeederSentimentIcon.vue` — sentiment icon component exists (currently for feed articles); can be adapted for mention sentiment display
- `contentstudio-frontend/src/modules/discovery/config/routes/discovery.js` — discovery module routing

---

### Reusable Components / Services

1. **Topic/Keyword Filtering System** — `CustomTopicsModel` with `any_keywords`, `must_contain`, `exclude` arrays plus `match_type` field; domain inclusion/exclusion; directly reusable as the foundation for listening keyword configuration
2. **Notification & Alert Infrastructure** — proven queue-based notification system (Kafka, Redis, Laravel jobs); email template system via Lumotive; real-time push via Pusher; tag-based organization — all reusable for mention alerts
3. **Sentiment Icon UI** — `FeederSentimentIcon.vue` already exists; adapt for mention sentiment labels
4. **Social Platform OAuth / Webhook Connectors** — OAuth2 connectors for all major platforms; Facebook + Instagram webhooks already subscribed to `mentions` field — this is a significant head start for mention ingestion
5. **Feedly RSS Feed Parsing** — custom domain inclusion/exclusion, OPML import/export; reusable for web/blog monitoring source management
6. **Cache Helper Pattern** — `CacheHelper::clearCustomTopicCache()` pattern; reuse for active-keyword caching in Redis

---

### Integration Points

1. **Navigation** — new "Social Listening" module sits alongside `discovery`, `analytics`, `publisher`, `inbox-revamp` in the main sidebar
2. **Routes** — create new route group `/social-listening` or `/mentions` parallel to `/discovery` and `/analytics`
3. **API** — extend existing Facebook/Instagram webhook handlers (already subscribed to `mentions` field); add mention ingestion endpoints
4. **Database** — new MongoDB collections needed:
   - `listening_topics` — monitored keywords/brands (similar schema to `custom_topics`)
   - `mentions` — mention records (mention_id, platform, author, sentiment, timestamp, body, link, keyword_matched)
   - `listening_alerts` — alert rules (threshold, notification channels, topic_id)
5. **Queue** — extend `config/kafka.php` with new topics: `contentstudio.mentions.ingest`, `contentstudio.mentions.sentiment`; use `InboxQueueMasterJob` as the implementation pattern

---

### Technical Considerations

1. **MongoDB Storage** — high-volume mentions collection; index on `platform`, `keyword_id`, `timestamp`, `sentiment`, `workspace_id`; partition strategy by date or workspace to manage volume
2. **API Rate Limits** — Twitter API v2: 100k tweets/month (standard tier); Facebook/Instagram: webhook-based (push, not pull); need queue backoff strategy and graceful failure handling
3. **Kafka Architecture** — two new consumer groups: `mentions.ingest` (platform polling → MongoDB) and `mentions.sentiment` (raw text → sentiment classifier → update MongoDB); dead-letter queue already configured
4. **Real-Time Updates** — Pusher broadcast channels for live mention stream; one channel per listening topic per workspace; follows existing Inbox broadcast pattern
5. **Sentiment Classification** — no current backend NLP service; options: (a) external API (Google Natural Language, OpenAI), (b) internal ML model, (c) use existing AI infrastructure if Claude API is already integrated for other features
6. **Caching** — Redis cache for active keywords/brands per workspace (avoid DB hit on every ingest event); invalidate on topic update; follow existing `CacheHelper` pattern

---

### Gap Analysis

**Must Build from Scratch:**
- Mention ingestion engine — no system currently polls social platforms for brand/keyword mentions
- Sentiment analysis backend service — no NLP pipeline exists (UI placeholder only)
- Brand/keyword listening configuration — no UI or API for users to define what to monitor
- Alert rules — no threshold-based alerting with spike detection
- Analytics dashboard — no charts/reports for mention trends, sentiment distribution, top sources

**Platform API Gaps:**
- Twitter Streaming API not integrated (publishing only)
- Facebook/Instagram webhook infrastructure exists but mention filtering logic is missing
- LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit monitoring — no existing integration

**Frontend UI Gaps:**
- No "Social Listening" or "Mentions" module routes
- No keyword/brand management UI
- No mention stream view or filtering UI
- No sentiment filtering, sorting, or charting
- No alert configuration interface

**Data Pipeline Gaps:**
- No scheduled mention polling job
- No mention deduplication logic (same mention appearing across platforms)
- No mention enrichment (author follower count, engagement rank)
- No MongoDB schema / migration for new collections
- No API response resource classes for mentions endpoints
